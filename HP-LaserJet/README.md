## Templated Grafana Dashboard for HP LaserJet Printers

Detailed dashboard for monitoring of HP LaserJet printers via SNMP.


The Telegraf collector configuration is MIB-based so all of the required MIBs will need to be available for the collector to perform the needed translations.  Most SNMP distributions available on most platforms already provide these, except for one (see below).  This configuration uses the "new" SNMP plugin for Telegraf, so SNMP monitoring must be enabled in the printer configuration.  The 'agents' list in the configuration is of the actual printers themselves.

The included collector configuration uses a few HP-printer-specific OIDs defined in various HP MIBs.  These may be difficult to find currently as the HP developer portal seems to have been taken offline.  One example is included in the `mibs` directory that should be suitable for use here.  Add this to one of the search directories for the native SNMP implementation where Telegraf is installed, if needed.

### Important Dependency Note
The included Telegraf:SNMP plugin configuration depends upon a feature that is not yet part of the released Telegraf 1.2.
Object `IP-MIB::ipSystemStatsTable` leverages a non-accessible index to identify the IP Version for the statistics in each row.  The actual index is the sub-id for each table element, of which the Telegraf:SNMP plugin does not currently make
available as a field or tag.  However there is a pull-request to add this capability using a new flag 'index_as_tag'
-  'index_as_tag' on tables requires PR \#2366 for support
  -  See https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/issues/1948

There are two options:
 1.  Wait for a formal release of Telegraf with the needed support.  The noted PR is tagged for the Telegraf v1.3 milestone.  
 2.  Build custom version of Telegraf with the required PR applied.  The changes needed are entirely contained within the single `plugins/inputs/snmp/snmp.go` source file so this is a relatively simple change.  

### Dependencies
1. [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/) as the time-series database
2. [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/) as the collector.  See above note about specific details.


### Quick Start
1. Enable SNMP monitoring on your HP LaserJet printers via BUI or printer panel.
2. Merge the included `telegraf-inputs.conf` with your local Telegraf instance configuration (or create a new instance)
  1. Edit the SNMP 'community' string as appropriate
  2. Edit the 'agents' list to include all of your monitored printers
  3. If you do _not_ already have an InfluxDB output configured in your Telegraf instance:
    1. Merge the included `telegraf-outputs.conf` with your local Telegraf instance configuration:
    2. Edit the URL to your new InfluxDB instance
    3. Edit the username and password for this InfluxDB instance as appropriate
3.  Restart Telegraf
4.  Import the included `hp-laserjet-dashboard.json` as a new dashboard into your local Grafana instance
