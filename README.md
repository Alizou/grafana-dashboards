## Grafana Dashbaords

Simply a set of miscellaneous [Grafana](http://grafana.org) dashboards.

Each dashboard is in its own directory, along with any dependencies such
as collector configurations.

1.  Edit and/or merge any required collector configurations
2.  Restart/refresh collector if necessary
3.  Import the .json as a new dashboard in your local Grafana instance
